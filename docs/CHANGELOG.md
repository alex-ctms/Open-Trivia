# Changelog / Roadmap

## v0.3.22
- Fixed a critical bug where every backend route was reachable only at its bare path (e.g. `/categories`) while the frontend and this chart's ingress both call `/api/...` - added the `/api` prefix to all ~101 routes so login, gameplay, and admin all work again.
- Added Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) SSO: confidential-client OAuth login, an admin panel settings card, and a "Login Methods" toggle section (Standard Login / Microsoft SSO / Discord SSO / Teams SSO are all independently on/off, with at least one required).
- Added Teams SSO: an admin-triggered "Post a Question Now" posts an Adaptive Card to a Teams channel via a Power Automate flow (`services/open-trivia-powerautomate/OpenTrivia.zip`); answer buttons sign the player in through Microsoft SSO and land on a results page. Microsoft sign-in also caches the player's Graph profile photo as their avatar.
- Simplified the footer's Creditation section for an internal deployment: removed social icons and the Buy Me a Coffee link, replaced with a "Star my GitHub Project" link.
- Migrated primary hosting to a self-hosted GitLab (CI/CD builds and pushes images there) and to Kubernetes via ArgoCD, alongside the existing Helm chart / GitHub / docker-compose options.
- Refreshed the full category/question set from the latest `Open-Trivia-Questions` live sync export: 43 categories (including several new Computer/DevOps/Kubernetes/Traefik/Kong/ArgoCD/GitLab certification categories, plus Python and Geology), ~53,400 questions total.

## v0.3.21
- Added Discord /shareplay command: creates a Share Play room and returns an embed with a clickable join link and room code. Auto-joins the room when the link is opened in a browser.
- Added admin Category Merge: select two categories to merge one into the other. Flagged as destructive with a confirmation checkbox and warning modal. A full backup snapshot is saved automatically before every merge. All questions, game sessions, score resets, custom category groups, and scheduled trivia references are updated.
- Added Report Player button in SharePlay actions bar, alongside the existing question Report button. Lets players report others for Inappropriate Behavior, Cheating, or Harassment with optional description. Stored in new player_reports table.
- Added Set Host in SharePlay room settings: host can transfer host status to another player via dropdown. Uses new transfer_host socket event.
- Added mobile-responsive SharePlay lobby grids: Live Room and Join by Code stack vertically on mobile with Live Room on top.
- Added SharePlay vote-to-kick system: click a player's name to initiate a vote. Other players see a yellow warning banner and can vote for or against. Majority or tie kicks the player.
- Strike system: 1st kick = 30-minute SharePlay ban, 2nd kick = 24-hour ban, 3rd kick = permanent ban until admin appeal.
- Banned users can submit an appeal from their Profile page (above Recent Activity). Admins review and approve/deny appeals.
- Mobile-responsive SharePlay layout: votes at top, trivia centered, suggest/report below trivia, players and scoring at the bottom. TV mode also stacks vertically on mobile.
- Improved .btn CSS with border-radius, hover opacity, and disabled states for better visibility.
- Added admin panel SharePlay Moderation tab with kick warnings (filterable), ban list, and pending appeals management.
- Admins can now clear a user's leaderboard, delete a user's account, or block a user from the server entirely from the Users tab.
- New database tables: shareplay_kick_strikes, shareplay_bans, shareplay_appeals, shareplay_kick_history.
- New API endpoints for SharePlay moderation, user appeals, and admin management.
- Fixed dark mode: .btn class now inherits card-bg background and border-color so buttons like Clear Filters, Browse, Rename, and Cancel are no longer white-on-white.

## v0.3.20
- Fixed Share Play "xhr poll error" by repairing the CRA dev server proxy in setupProxy.js. The proxy was stripping the /socket.io path prefix when forwarding to the backend, caused by http-proxy-middleware v3 path-rewriting changes. Added pathRewrite to restore the prefix and created separate proxy instances for /api and /socket.io.
- Added explicit Socket.IO server transport config, 60s ping timeout, and allowEIO3 for better reverse-proxy compatibility.
- Updated Socket.IO client to force polling-first transport with 30 reconnection attempts and exponential backoff for proxy-friendly connections.
- Removed hardcoded admin credentials from init-db.js; admin seeding now uses ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_SEED_PASSWORD env vars.
- Replaced em dashes with hyphens across all source files to prevent encoding issues.

## v0.3.19
- Added include/exclude category filtering in solo Play with visible category pills.
- Added saved custom category presets that users can name, reapply, and remove from their Profile.
- Renamed the user-facing Stats navigation/page language to Profile while keeping activity summaries available.
- Added include/exclude category filtering to Share Play room creation and host/admin room settings.
- Added inline category renaming in the admin Categories section.
- Updated admin category pack import so CSV files can be uploaded directly without a zip when no images are needed.
- Added URL import support for CSV URLs and shared Google Sheets CSV exports, alongside existing GitHub/zip imports.
- Added the `custom_category_groups` database table and runtime migration for existing deployments.

## v0.3.18
- Added **Suggest a Question** and **⚠ Report** buttons to the Share Play game view, matching the feature set of solo play.
- Both actions persist across question changes - opening either panel while a round transitions keeps the modal or dropdown open on the next question.
- Report captures the question ID at the moment the dropdown is opened, so a mid-report question change still targets the correct question.
- Report dropdown supports General / Inappropriate / Incorrect types with an optional free-text description, matching the solo game report flow.
- Confirmed reports and feedback messages are shown inline in the action bar.

## v0.3.17
- Added **Share Play** - real-time multiplayer trivia powered by Socket.io with a persistent Live Room and player-created private/public rooms.
- Live Room runs continuously with auto-cycling questions and is accessible to all players without a code.
- Private rooms use a randomized 4-digit code; the first player is host, and admin transfers automatically to the highest-scoring player if the host leaves. Empty rooms auto-delete after 5 minutes.
- Public rooms are listed in the Share Play lobby sorted by player count, with a join button and live refresh.
- Full host and admin settings panels: timer (5–120 s), base correct/incorrect points, time bonus multiplier, speed-medal bonuses (🥇🥈🥉) for the first three voters, category filter, and public/private toggle.
- Admin-only Live Room settings panel (visible to admin-role users only) with the same full control surface.
- Scoring: correct = base pts + time-bonus × seconds-remaining + speed-medal bonus; incorrect = flat pts. Session score resets after 30 minutes of inactivity.
- Logged-in players' Share Play points are added to their leaderboard score and recorded in game history.
- Toggle: **Live Votes** - show per-option vote breakdown bars (off by default) or hide them.
- Toggle: **Voter Count** - show/hide the X/Y voted counter.
- Toggle: **Show players' answers** - reveal which option each player chose.
- Toggle: **Player stats** - show answered/correct counts in the scoreboard.
- Toggle: **A–F accuracy rating** - per-player accuracy badge derived from session history.
- Toggle: **Allow guess changes** - players can revise their answer before time runs out.
- Early round end: if all players vote and guess-change is off, the round ends immediately; if guess-change is on, a 5-second warning countdown fires and the round ends early unless someone changes their answer.
- Top-10 session scoreboard visible throughout the round; logged-in players see their personal score highlighted.
- Default settings match the configured admin preset: timer 15 s, correct 5 pts, incorrect 1 pt, time bonus ×0.25, gold/silver/bronze +5/+3/+1, voter count on, live vote breakdown off.

## v0.3.16
- Synced the bundled Discord bot with paginated schedule listings so large recurring-job lists fit within Discord's message limits.
- Updated the Discord bot interaction code to use current Discord.js flags-based ephemeral replies and `ClientReady` startup handling.

## v0.3.15
- Added Discord schedule run-status tracking so recurring trivia now records whether the last attempt succeeded or failed.
- Updated backend schedule bookkeeping so the next scheduled run reflects the most recent attempt instead of stale timestamps.
- Synced the bundled Discord bot with schedule hardening, bulk removal support, and dynamic version reporting improvements.

## v0.3.14
- Stabilized the gameplay timer chip so it keeps a fixed width and no longer shifts the difficulty badge as the timer updates.
- Updated Docker Compose frontend runtime defaults so the footer version now follows the deployed frontend image tag (`latest` by default, or a pinned `FRONTEND_IMAGE_TAG` when provided).
- Refined the frontend success feedback with a faster rainbow correct-answer animation, emoji star-burst particles, and smaller footer logo sizing while keeping the header logo at its original size.

## v0.3.11
- Added support for two-answer or four-answer questions across admin question creation, user suggestions, and backend validation.
- Added Discord bot question suggestions through `/suggest-question`, sending requests into the admin review queue.
- Flagged Discord-submitted review items in the admin Review Queue with a `Discord Bot` badge.
- Removed `A/B/C/D` prefixes from Discord answer buttons so they display only the answer text.

## v0.3.10
- Added dedicated Discord scoring defaults in admin scoring settings, with fixed per-difficulty values that ignore answer timing.
- Set default Discord trivia scoring to Easy `+5`, Medium `+10`, and Hard `+15`, while keeping site gameplay on the existing time-based scoring model.
- Updated Discord answer responses to include the difficulty and awarded points, such as `Correct. This Medium question was +10 points.`
- Defaulted the admin panel to open on the Review Queue tab instead of Questions.
- Updated the Discord bot to display question images when a trivia item includes one.
- Improved Discord scheduler command handling and empty-list channel messaging.

## v0.3.6
- Added public Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pages to the frontend.
- Added env/runtime-config support for deployment-specific legal operator, contact, site URL, and policy effective date values.
- Linked the new legal pages from the app footer and populated them with product-specific disclosures covering account data, Discord integrations, backups, audit logs, privacy controls, and security practices.
- Added a configurable Discord bot invite URL in the admin Data section, with an env default pointing at the Discord application authorization link.

## v0.3.5
- Increased the Discord bot default trivia timeout to 24 hours and aligned the root Docker Compose and env defaults with that behavior.
- Expired Discord trivia messages are now deleted after timeout instead of remaining in-channel.
- Incorrect Discord answers now reveal the correct answer privately to the player.
- Discord users who answer through the bot are now auto-created in Open-Trivia so their scores can be recorded without prior site login.

## v0.3.4
- Added the Discord Bot admin settings card and bot settings APIs to the deployed backend/frontend flow, including enable/disable, bot token, service URL, and public app URL controls.
- Added refreshed backend/frontend GHCR images so production deployments can pick up the Discord bot admin configuration UI.
- Trimmed blank answer slots from question payloads so web gameplay and bot sessions only show real answers.
- Updated the web game answer grid to rebalance layouts for two-answer questions such as True/False.
- Expanded the Discord bot command set with `/categories` and `/help`, plus scheduler channel targeting and richer slash-command handling.

## v0.3.3

- Added admin-managed Discord SSO settings in the Data tab, including an in-app setup guide and runtime enable/disable controls.
- Added Discord avatar support across the signed-in header, admin users list, and leaderboard, with Gravatar fallback preserved.
- Added persisted `discord_sso_settings` storage and Discord profile fields on users for avatar and account-link metadata.
- Added the `services/open-trivia-discord` submodule and initial Discord bot service with `/ot`, `/leaderboard`, `/otschedule`, DM play, public button-based play, and recurring trivia schedules.
- Added Discord bot backend APIs, bot settings in the admin Data tab, and server-scoped Discord leaderboard tracking.
